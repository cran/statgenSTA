\title{Extract statistics from Fitted Models}
\usage{
extract(
  STA,
  trials = names(STA),
  traits = NULL,
  what = "all",
  keep = NULL,
  restoreColNames = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{STA}{An object of class STA.}

\item{trials}{A character vector of trials for which the statistics should be
computed. If not supplied, statistics are computed for all trials that have
been modeled.}

\item{traits}{A character vector of traits for which the statistics should be
computed. If not supplied, statistics are computed for all traits that have
been modeled.}

\item{what}{A character vector indicating which statistics should be
computed. Most statistics are available for all models, some only for models
fitted using a certain engine. If this is the case, this is indicated in the
list with options in details.\cr
If \code{what = "all"}, all available statistics are computed.}

\item{keep}{A character vector of column(s) in the object of class
\code{\link{TD}} used for modeling. These columns will be kept as output when
computing fitted values, residuals, standardized residuals and rMeans.
Columns can also be kept when computing (se)BLUEs and (se)BLUPs but only if
the column to keep contains unique values for the modeled variables, i.e. a
column repId with several different values per genotype cannot be kept.}

\item{restoreColNames}{Should the original column names be restored in the
output of the extracted data?}
}
\value{
A list with, per trial for which statistics have been extracted, a
list of those statistics.
}
