\description{
A dataset converted to a TD object containing raw plot data for one trial
from a series of wheat trials conducted in Mexico by CIMMYT. The different
trials took place under different regimes of irrigation and temperature,
there were 4 trials across two years, labelled as DRIP05, HEAT05, HEAT06 and
IRRI06. The TD object only contains the data for HEAT05. Within each trial,
a set of 167 progeny of a RIL (Recombinant Inbred Line; 8 generations)
population were tested alongside the population parents (Seri and Babax). A
lattice design with two replicates was used for each trial. In the first
replicate the entries were not randomized, as they were considered to be a
random selection from a population.
